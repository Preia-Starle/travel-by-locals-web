# travel-by-locals-web
## Practice application. 
### Purpose: users can add and share travel recommendations from a city they live in and check recommendations of others
Current features:
- responsive introductory main page (basic styling + image, video, song, text)
- button to redirect to a form
- form to GET user input
- submit button to save data to local storage
- successful submit popup alert + timer for redirect 
- onsubmit redirect to display information for the user to review
- button to clear storage and go back to the main page (and repeat the process if desired)
- dummy button to save user input into a database

Backlog:
- add a field "city" to the form
- add a feature to save images and videos from the form (to local storage -(5MB) limit vs. move the option to a later step - save into a database directly)
- make a database connection
- save user input into a database
- create form dropdowns based on previous users' input
- add appropriate styling for the display
